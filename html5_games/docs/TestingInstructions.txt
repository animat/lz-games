Lots of ways to test!

Option A:
  - cd into the html5_games/sources directory
  - run the http-server . command
  - browse to... http://localhost:8080/bathTubBubbles/game.html?gameid=bathTubBubbles_69857
    - the gameid is a direct reference to an XML file in the sources/svr directory

Option B:
  - same as above...
  - browse to... http://localhost:8080/Frame/web.html?gameSWF=bathTubBubbles&gameid=bathTubBubbles_69857

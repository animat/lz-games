Build code to provide more robust building of minified games.

Commands:

"bash build.sh" (replaces bash prep.sh).
Installs required npm / gulp modules
Builds raw and min games in build directory

For gulp commands, set path to local gulp by running ". ./build.env" 
gulp commands as follows:

"gulp compile_game" (run inside game directory)
Creates (game)/min folder with minified code files.

"gulp build_game" (run inside game directory)
Creates build/min/(game) folder with minified code files
Creates build/raw/(game) folder with uncompressed code files

"gulp build_lib"
Creates build/min/lib folder stripped of css/js
Creates build/raw/lib folder with uncompressed code files

"gulp build_svr"
Creates build/min/svr folder
Creates build/raw/svr folder

"gulp build_all"
Runs "build_lib", "build_svr" and "build_game" for every game in
sources folder.
